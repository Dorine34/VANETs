# VANETs, Nash approach


Implementation of several algorithm corresponding to VANETs with convergence to a Nash Equilibrium

Language : Java, with extern librairy JBotSim AS : Convergence to a Nash equilibrium through the selection of RAT (Radio Access Technology) and path. 

3 algorithms

AODV : Algo BellmanFord (without convergence), minHop 
progDyn : maxThroughput (without convergence)
SelectionAlgorithm : RAT and senders algorithm (convergence)


Input 2 scenarios :
scenario 1 : 12 static nodes avec 2 sources
scenario 2 : 5 static nodes with ne source and 1 node arrived

Output : switching number and reached optimality
